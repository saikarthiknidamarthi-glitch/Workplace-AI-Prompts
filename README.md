# Workplace-AI-Prompts

Open, vendor-agnostic **AI prompts & templates** for everyday workplace operations — Admin, Facilities, HR, Travel, Compliance, Events, and more.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
Most companies already use tools like Microsoft 365/Copilot, ServiceNow, Envoy, EHS platforms, etc.  
This kit complements those tools with **ready-to-use prompts and templates** tailored to workplace roles so teams can:
- Save time on repetitive tasks (MOMs, reports, checklists, vendor notes)
- Standardize outputs and handoffs
- Onboard new team members quickly
- Stay vendor-neutral (works with any AI assistant)
