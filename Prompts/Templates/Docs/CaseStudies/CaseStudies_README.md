# CaseStudies

This folder contains **practical test runs** of prompts and templates from the Workplace-AI-Prompts starter kit.

## Purpose
- Demonstrate how prompts generate **industry-standard outputs** in real workplace contexts.  
- Provide **rubric evaluations** (clarity, relevance, tone, usability) for transparency.  
- Serve as **evidence** that this kit works beyond theory.

## Files
- `CaseStudy_Testing_Prompts.docx` â†’ Random sample prompts (2 from Phase-1, 2 from Phase-2) executed and evaluated.

## Roadmap
Future case studies will include:
- Full workflow simulations (e.g., Visitor Management end-to-end)  
- Comparative outputs (AI vs Human baseline)  
- Case studies for new templates (MOM, Incident Reports, Budgeting)
